#Lean-To-Move DemoThis repository contains a unity demo of the Lean-To-Move locomotion mechanic. The core scripts can be found in `Assets/Scripts/`. For developers, `PivotMove.cs` provides an abstract class that handles all the core mechanics of this kind of locomotion. `LinearPivotToMove.cs` shows a very simple implementation of `PivotMove` and is the implementation used in the demo.#RunningDownload the repository and run LeanToMoveDemo.exe.
