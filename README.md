#Lean-To-Move Demo
![Lean-To-Move](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Erupac/LeanToMove/master/Images/ScreenShot3.PNG)
This repository contains a unity demo of the Lean-To-Move locomotion mechanic. The core scripts can be found in `Assets/Scripts/`. For developers, `PivotMove.cs` provides an abstract class that handles all the core mechanics of this kind of locomotion. `LinearPivotToMove.cs` shows a very simple implementation of `PivotMove` and is the implementation used in the demo.
